[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-the-first-project)

This is my first tutorial, that gave me introduction to the essentials of Angular by walking you through building a simple e-commerce site with a catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form. It uses the StackBlitz online development environment so i could get started right away.
